The longest path problem in general is NP-hard, but since the graph \\(G\\)
constructed from the 'nests-in' relation is a directed acyclic graph, we may
solve it by solving the shortest path problem of \\(-G\\).

Other than that, this
[problem](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=39)
is quite straightforward to
[solve](https://github.com/clchiou/uva-problem-set/blob/master/solved/103/103.cc).
