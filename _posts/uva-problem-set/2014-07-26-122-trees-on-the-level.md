This
[problem](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=24&page=show_problem&problem=58)
requires you to design a somewhat cleaver data structure of binary tree.

You data structure has to be able to store an incomplete binary tree;
so plain-old pointers would not suffice for this problem.
Also, be careful of corner cases, like missing tree root.

A reference solution is
[here](https://github.com/clchiou/uva-problem-set/blob/master/solved/122/122.cc).
