This is a two dimensional geometry
[problem](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=24&page=show_problem&problem=79)
with two traps.

* Equal-to-zero test should have precision of at least $10^{-8}.$
* Input might not be a triangle at all.

[Here](https://github.com/clchiou/uva-problem-set/blob/master/solved/143/143.cc)
is a reference solution.
