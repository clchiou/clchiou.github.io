This
[problem](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=3&page=show_problem&problem=131)
asks you to generate permutation of letters in alphabetically ascending order.

To solve this,
you may use the `next_permutation` function of the C++ standard library,
or write your permutation generator function.
A pitfall of this problem is that the alphabetical order is not the same as the ASCII code order.
In ASCII code we have
> A < B < ... < Z < a < b < ... < z.
But the problem clearly states that the alphabetical order is
> A < a < B < b < ... < Z < z.

A reference solution is
