Basically this
[problem](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=24&page=show_problem&problem=45)
asks you to implement a convex hull algorithm.

I implement Andrew's Monotone Chain, a variant of Graham Scan,
because it is not required to handle polar angle,
which can be quite tricky.
A reference solution is
