This
[problem](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=24&page=show_problem&problem=50)
challenges your ability to read through its cumbersome description.

Some notes:

* Walls are on the edge, i.e.,  
  `x == 1 || x == width || y == 1 || y == height`.
* A ball dies as soon as a movement causes its lifetime reaching zero and cannot gain points or (negative) cost.

A reference solution is
