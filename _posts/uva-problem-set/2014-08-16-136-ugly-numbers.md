You may solve this
[problem](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=24&page=show_problem&problem=72)
with best-first search.

You may think of all ugly numbers connected as a graph.
Two ugly numbers are connected if one is a multiple of 2, 3, or 5 of the other;
for example, 1 and 2 are connected, and 3 and 6 are connected.
And you search this graph (starting from 1) until you visit the 1500-th node
via a best-first search that smaller nodes are searched first.

Here is a reference
