You may solve this "problem":http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=3&page=show_problem&problem=43 with prime factorization.

Let $h_0$ denote the height of the initial cat, and $w$ denote the number of worker cats; you are asked to find two positive integers:

* The cat-in-hat constant $N$
* Level of hats $L$

Which satisfy the following constraints:

* There are exactly $w$ leave nodes: $N^L = w$
* The height of worker cats is one: $1 \leq \frac{h_0}{(N+1)^L} \lt 2$
* Note that the problem does not say that $h_0$ must be a power of $N + 1$

Then the answer:

* The number of non-worker cats is \[\sum_{k=0}^{L-1} N^k\]
* The sum of all the cats' heights is \[\sum_{k=0}^{L} h_0 \left(\frac{N}{N+1}\right)^k\]

A very inefficient method is to enumerate all possible values of $N$ from $1$ to $h_0 - 1.$

A faster algorithm is to generate possible values of $N$ with prime factorization of $w.$

For the ease of exposition, let $w = 2176782336000000 = 2^{18} 3^{12} 5^6.$ The factors of exponents are:

* {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18} are factors of 18
* {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12} are factors of 12
* {1, 2, 3, 6} are factors of 6

Then only {1, 2, 3, 6} are common factors of 18, 12, and 6.  We may use the common factors of exponents to represent $w = N^L$ as $(2^{18} 3^{12} 5^6)^1,$ $(2^9 3^6 5^3)^2,$ $(2^6 3^4 5^2)^3,$ or $(2^3 3^2 5^1)^6.$  Then we pick the $(N, L)$ pair of which $\frac{h_0}{(N+1)^L}$ is closet to $1.$

When compared to the brute-force method, we have reduced the size of search space from >2176782336000000 to 4.  Impressive, right?
