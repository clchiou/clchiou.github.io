This
[problem](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=40)
is a shortest path problem in disguise.

Given the conversion table $C\_1$, you may construct $C\_i$ from
$C\_{i-1}$ for $i = 2 \dots n$ using Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm so
that $C\_i \[u, v\]$ is the largest conversion rate starting from currency
$u$ to currency $v$ with less than or equal to $i$ transactions.

Here is a reference
