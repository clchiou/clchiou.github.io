You may
[solve](https://github.com/clchiou/uva-problem-set/blob/master/solved/108/108.cc)
this
[problem](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=44)
with a technique called
[*summed area table*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summed_area_table),
also known as *integral image*.

A small trick to make your codes simpler is to use sentinel: Index your matrix
starting from \\(1\\) rather than from \\(0\\) and fill elements of integral
image at \\(0\\)-row and \\(0\\)-column with \\(0\\)'s so that you will not get
index out of bound error when computing rectangle sum.
