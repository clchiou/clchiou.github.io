You may enumerate all permutations to
[solve](https://github.com/clchiou/uva-problem-set/blob/master/solved/140/140.cc)
this
[problem](http://uva.onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&category=24&page=show_problem&problem=76).

There are no more than 8 nodes in the input graph;
so the maximum number of permutations is 40320,
and an exhaustive search is acceptable.
