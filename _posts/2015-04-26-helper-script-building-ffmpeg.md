title: Helper Script Building FFmpeg
---

I wrote a
[script](https://gist.github.com/clchiou/9f4490da1293aaa2b4b2)
for checking out dependeicies and then building
[FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
that basically just follows the steps outlined
[here](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide).
Why?  Because automation is cool!
