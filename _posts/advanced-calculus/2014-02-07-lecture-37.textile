h3. Disconnected and Totally Disconnected

_Definition._ A set $E$ is _totally disconnected_ if for all $x \ne y \in E,$ there exists $A, B \subset E$ such that $x \in A, y \in B,$ $A \cup B = E$ and $A$ and $B$ are separated.  (That is, $A \cup B$ forms a disconnected set.)

_Example._ $(0, 1) \cup (1, 2)$ is disconnected but not totally disconnected.

_Example._ Cantor set is totally disconnected.
