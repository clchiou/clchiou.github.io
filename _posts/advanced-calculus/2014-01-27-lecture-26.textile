h3. Prelude to Equivalence of Compactness and Sequential Compactness

Limit of a sequence and limit point of a set is almost interchangeable, but:
* There could be duplicated values in a sequence, but no in a set.
* This is why when proving properties of sequences, you sometimes have to consider finitely many values vs infinitely many values.

To sum up:

|<. $x_n \to x$ |=. $\nRightarrow$ |>. $x$ is a limit point of $A$...                             |
|               |                  |>. ...unless there are infinitely many values of the sequence |
|<. $x_n \to x$ |=. $\Leftarrow$   |>. $x$ is a limit point of $A$                                |
|<. Arithmetic  |                  |>. Topology                                                   |

h4. Bounded and closed vs (sequential) compactness

|<. Bounded and closed  |=. $\Rightarrow$ because...     |>. Compactness            |
|                       |=. Nested Interval Theorem      |                          |
|                       |=. Completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ |                          |
|<. Bounded and closed  |=. $\Leftarrow$ because...      |>. Compactness            |
|                       |=. $\delta/2$ argument          |                          |
|<. Bounded and closed  |=. $\Rightarrow$ because...     |>. Sequential compactness |
|                       |=. Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem  |                          |
|                       |=. Completeness of $\mathbb{R}$ |                          |
|<. Bounded and closed  |=. $\Leftarrow$ because...      |>. Sequential compactness |
|                       |=. Triangle inequality          |                          |
|                       |=. Metric space                 |                          |

To prove compactness $\Leftrightarrow$ sequential compactness in generic metric space, we cannot go through the bounded-and-closed path, which requires completeness. We need to go through properties of topological space.
