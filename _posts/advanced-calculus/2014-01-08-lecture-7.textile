h3. Continuum Hypothesis

Is there a set $A$ that ${\small\#}\mathbb{N} < {\small\#}A < {\small\#}\mathbb{R}$?

Consider "Cantor set":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set:

_Property._ Cantor set is measure zero.  \[\begin{array}{cl}
  & \frac{1}{3} + 2\cdot\frac{1}{3^2} + 4\cdot\frac{1}{3^3} + \cdots \\
= & \frac{1}{3}\left[ 1 + \frac{2}{3} + \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 + \cdots \right] \\
= & \frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{1-\frac{2}{3}} \\
= & 1 \\
\end{array}\]  So $m(\text{Cantor set}) = 0.$

_Property._ $[0, 1]$ is uncountable.

Idea: Use Nested Interval Theorem.  Suppose $[0, 1]$ is countable.  Let $\{ x_n \} = [0, 1]$ and split it into three sub-intervals: $[0, \frac{1}{3}],$ $[\frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}],$ and $[\frac{2}{3}, 1].$  Then $x_1$ must not belong to one of the sub-intervals, call it $I_1.$  Split $I_1$ into three sub-intervals.  Then $x_2$ must not belong to one of the sub-intervals, call it $I_2.$  Continue this process and we will have $I_1 \supset I_2 \supset \cdots,$ and $|I_n| = \frac{1}{3^n} \rightarrow 0.$  By Nested Interval Theorem, there is a real number $x \in [0, 1]$ such that $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty I_n = \{ x \}.$  However, for all $n,$ we have $x \in I_n$ and so $x \neq x_n.$  Thus, $[0, 1] \neq \{ x_n \},$ which contradicts to our assumption above.

_Property._ Cantor set is uncountable; actually, Cantor set can be mapped 1-to-1 and onto to $[0, 1].$

Idea: Use Ternary representation.  Cantor set recursively breaks a closed interval into three parts; we may use $0$ for the left sub-interval, and $2$ for the right sub-interval.  Then for all $x$ of Cantor set, the ternary representation of $x$ is $0.\beta_1\beta_2\beta_3\dots$ where $\beta_i$ is $0$ or $2.$  We can easily map every $x$ to an unique $y \in [0, 1].$  The binary representation of $y$ is $0.\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\dots$ where $\alpha_i$ is $0$ or $1.$  The mapping from Cantor set to $[0, 1]$ is: If $\beta_i = 0,$ then $\alpha_i = 0,$ and if $\beta_i = 1,$ then $\alpha_i = 1.$

So Cantor set is measure zero, but its cardinality is the same with $\mathbb{R}.$  We had dug out so many numbers, but it was still not enough.
