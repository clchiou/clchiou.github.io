h3. Path Connected

_Definition._ A set $S$ is _path connected_ if for all $x, y \in S,$ there is a continuous curve $\Gamma \subset S$ joining $x, y.$

_Example._ $A = [-1, 0]$ and $B = \{ (x, y) \:|\: y = \sin \frac{1}{x}, x > 0 \}.$  $S = A \cup B$ is connected but not path connected.

_Theorem._ In a metric space, if a set is path connected, it is connected.

_Theorem._ In $\mathbb{R}^n,$ an open and connected set is path connected.

Path connectedness is "stronger" than connectedness in the senses that:
* In any metric space, path connectedness implies connectedness.
* You need $\mathbb{R}^n$ and openness for connectedness to imply path connectedness.

Special property of $\mathbb{R}^1:$ Any open set is a countable union of disjoint open balls.
