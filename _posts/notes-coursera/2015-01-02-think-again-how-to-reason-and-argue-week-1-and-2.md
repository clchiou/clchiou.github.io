Language proficiency is the foundation of making or analyzing arguments.

Argument:

* From some premises.
* Through a series of sentences or propositions.
* To a conclusion.

Types of argument:

* Persuasion (change people's belief).
* Justification (show people a reason to believe).
* Explanation (why something happened; why something is true).

Explanation vs prediction:

* Unexplainable but predictable, e.g., machine learning models.
* Explainable but unpredictable, e.g., non-quantifiable models.

**Language, meaning, and semantics** are crucial in understanding and analyzing arguments.

Ambiguity makes you harder to distinguish arguments from non-arguments.

The problem of skeptical regress (this is a philosophical problem):
Practically, we work around this problem by finding some shared assumptions
as our (starting) premises of an argument.

How to establish assumptions:

1. Assuring: Trust some authorities.
2. Guarding: Weaken the strength of the premises (so that people can not reject it).
  * Extent: All---some.
  * Probability: Must---might.
  * Mental: Know---tend to believe.
3. Discounting:
  * Citing and discounting criticisms.
  * The trick of discounting straw people.

Rule of thumb: Think about the objections that the arguer is **not** considering.

Expressing preference is not making an evaluation.
Evaluation: Good vs bad, beautiful vs ugly, etc.
