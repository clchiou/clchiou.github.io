Chunking
--------

* Working memory may hold only ~4 chunks.
* The "puzzle fitting" analogy: A chunk is a larger piece from puzzle pieces.
* Build chunk (chunking):
  * **Focus**.
  * **Practice**.
  * **Bottom-up**: Build larger chunks from smaller chunks.
  * **Transfer** knowledge.
* Top-down: **Context** helps you build new chunks.
  * Why this chunk is useful?
  * When to use this chunk?
* Tactics of building chunks:
  * **Recall** (what you've learned?)
  * Read, recall, read, recall, ...
  * Mini-test yourself (a kind of recall).
  * Deliberately practice something **slightly more difficult** (out of your comfort zone).
  * **Interleaving**: Don't learn sequentially---jump around!
