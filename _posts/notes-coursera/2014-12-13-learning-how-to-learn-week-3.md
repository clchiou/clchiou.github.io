Procrastination
---------------

* **Habit (zombie mode).**
* Work --- Leisure --- Sleep.
  * Your brain switches to diffuse mode during leisure time (background processing).
  * Your brain builds memory during sleep.
* Develop habit.
  1. The cue (the environment that triggers you into zombie mode).
  2. Routine.
  3. Reward.
  4. Belief (why do you do this?).
* To push back procrastination:
  - Focus on process (habits, your rituals), not product (results).
  - Eat your frog first.  Once you start, you will feel better.
* Memory tips:
  - **Spaced repetition.**
  - "Memory Palace".
  - Use other senses (look, smell, taste, sound) to help you associate/memorize things.
  - Hand writing.
  - Two side flash cards.
* List tomorrow's TODOs before you go to sleep.
